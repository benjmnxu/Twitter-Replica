# Twitter-Replica

http://benjmnxu.pythonanywhere.com/

My project is a replica of Twitter, named Fwitter ("Fake Twitter"). It uses django and html to create an easily navigable UI and allows users to register/log into accounts, tweet their thoughts, see tweets from other people, and look through their own profile. To accomplish this, I have used components, linked together frontend and backend frameworks, and integrated a django database. The page is also responsive and mobile friendly. Starting from almost scratch, with little django and html experience, this project took me roughly 8-10 hours, including the time I spent on learning the language. I did not include hashtags and searching for profiles. If I did, I would have included a search bar in the top navbar. Then, based off of what was searched, I would either bring the user to a profile or a page that compiles all tweets with a certain hashtag. This could be done through the database of users and "fweets" I incorporated. Each "fweet" is registered to a user, and thus there is the ability create profiles. The contents of each "fweet" are also readable, and thus we can create pages for "fweets" with a certain hashtag. Currently, the projected is hosted at the link placed above.
